	E. Definitions</h1>
<p>
	A couple of definitions of terms.&nbsp; It might come in handy, but personally, I believe the formulas in the next appendix are more useful.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Ampere (A):</strong> Is the SI unit for current I. It is defined in terms of the charge of an electron via 1 C = 1 A&middot;s.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Capacitor:</strong> An electronic component that stores energy in the form of an electric field.&nbsp; It resists a sudden change in voltage.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Conductance (S):</strong> The inverse of resistance. Measured in siemens, which are the inverse of ohms, 1 S = 1/&Omega;.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Coulomb (C):</strong>&nbsp; The elementary charge e of the electron is defined to be -1.602 176 634 &times; 10^&minus;19 Coulomb.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Current (I):</strong> The movement of charge carriers, usually electrons, in an electric field. It is measured in amperes.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Henry (H):</strong> The SI unit for inductance.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Impedance <strong>(&Omega;)</strong>:</strong> A more generalized form of resistance, also valid for AC type current. The impedance of a device can vary with the frequency of the electricity applied. A perfect resistor will have a constant impedance for all frequencies. Capacitors and inductors have varying impedances at different frequencies. It is measured in ohms.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Inductor:</strong> An inductor is a device that stores energy in a magnetic field. It opposes a sudden change in the flow of current.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Joule (J):</strong> The work required to exert a force of one newton (1 N) for one meter (1 m), 1 J = 1 N&middot;m.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Ohm (&Omega;):</strong> A measure of resistance or impedance, 1 &Omega; = 1 V/A.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Power (P):</strong> Voltage times current, measured in watts. The amount of work being done per unit time.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Resistance <strong>(&Omega;)</strong>:</strong> Properties of a circuit that impede the flow of electrons. Resistance converts electrical energy into phonons that are given off as waste heat. Resistance is measured in ohms.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Volt (V):</strong> A potential due to an electric field. One volt is defined as one joule of work per one coulomb of charge, 1 V = 1 J/C.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Voltage:</strong> Is the difference in electric potential between two points in an electric field.&nbsp; It is measured in volts.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Watt (W):</strong> A measure of power (P). A watt is a joule (1 J) of work done in a second (1 s). 1 W = 1 J/s</p>
